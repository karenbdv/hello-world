This is a time-honored tradition and traditions keep you humble. 

Hi world! 

Today is Earth Day 2017, so Happy 422! I wish I could do some yoga outside, 
but the rain is on and off today. So instead, I saw the Timbers play.
Overall, it has been a solid Earth Day. Tonight, I will have some beers with 
my friends at a Tiki Bar. Cheers!
